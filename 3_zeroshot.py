# """
# Alright, alright, back to business. You want to add two numbers in Python? Here's the most basic way to do it:

# ```python
# def add_numbers(x, y):
#   # This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
#   sum = x + y
#   return sum

# # Example usage:
# num1 = 5
# num2 = 10
# result = add_numbers(num1, num2)
# print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")
# ```

# **Explanation:**

# 1.  **`def add_numbers(x, y):`**: This line defines a function named `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`. These will be the numbers you want to add.
# 2.  **`sum = x + y`**:  This line performs the addition. It adds the values of `x` and `y` and assigns the result to a variable called `sum`.
# 3.  **`return sum`**: This line returns the calculated `sum` value back to wherever the function was called from.
# 4.  **`# Example usage:`**: This section shows how to use the function.
# 5.  **`num1 = 5`** and **`num2 = 10`**:  These lines assign the values 5 and 10 to the variables `num1` and `num2` respectively. You can change these values to any numbers you want to add.
# 6.  **`result = add_numbers(num1, num2)`**: This line calls the `add_numbers` function, passing `num1` and `num2` as arguments. The function calculates the sum, and the result is stored in the `result` variable.
# 7.  **`print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")`**: This line prints the result to the console, using an f-string to format the output nicely.

# **How to run this code:**

# 1.  Save the code in a file named, for example, `adder.py`.
# 2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
# 3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
# 4.  Run the code by typing `python adder.py` and pressing Enter.

# You'll see the output: `The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15`

# Now, try changing the values of `num1` and `num2` to see how it works.  Don't tell me you need help with that too...
